## Required Changes for Running

To get the model running, you need to:

1. Update the model initialization:
```python
# Old
model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base')

# New
model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-cased')
model.config.output_hidden_states = True
```

2. Modify the input processing:
```python
# Old
inputs = tokenizer(text)

# New
inputs = tokenizer(text, 
                  padding='max_length',
                  truncation=True,
                  max_length=128,
                  return_tensors='pt')
```

3. Update the prediction pipeline:
```python
# Old
logits = model(input_ids)

# New
outputs = model(input_ids=input_ids,
               attention_mask=attention_mask,
               token_type_ids=token_type_ids)
```
